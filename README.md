# PFM_reader
A simple command line PFM image reader for windows.

### Important info:
This programs tries very rudimentally to convert an HDR image to RGB colors via a crude normalization. Colors will not be completely accurate.

The command line has a maximum width of 80 characters, so bigger images will be compressed before being displayed.

### This is an EXPERIMENTAL release! Unexpected behaviour *might* happen.
